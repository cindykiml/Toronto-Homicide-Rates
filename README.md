# Toronto Homicide Rates

## Overview
This repository contains all of the files I used in order to write my paper on Toronto's increasing homicide rates (excluding online literature pieces). I downloaded the dataset from Toronto Open Data and looked processed the data into tables and graphs in order to observe a pattern in homicide rates and its causes. After, I looked at which neighbourhood has the highest homicide rate. My findings indicate that gun violence in Toronto is on the rise. Also, the top six neighbourhoods with the greatest rates were primarily low-income neighbourhoods. I then used relevant literature to support my argument that there is a correlation between increasing violence and economic disparity in Toronto.
