2.1 Data Source & Implications

The data used in this paper was taken from Toronto Open Data, a catalogue of datasets created by the City of Toronto to increase transparency and encourage data literacy @R-opendatatoronto. This open data allows communuities to engage in political conversations and raise awareness to policymakers and other residents. The dataset I used was the Toronto Police's Annual Statistical Report on Homicides. The raw data includes homicides form 2004 to 2020 in each neighbourhood and includes homicide type. This includes shooting, stabbing, and other. The data also includes geo-spatial data that can be used to pin point specific homicide locations on a map. However, to protect the privacy of parties, the pin points are moved to the nearest intersection [@TorontoOpenData]. As a result, homicide numbers by division or neighbourhood may be inaccurate as the exact number of homicides within geographical boundaries are not reflected [@TorontoOpenData]. This means there is a possibility that this data could be biased depending on how much or little the Police offset case locations.

There are ethical implications to consider with this data. There is some ambiguity on what is considered a homicide case. The Toronto Police Open Data Documentation says that offences include first degree murder, second degree murder, and manslaughter. It also states, "Deaths caused by criminal negligence, suicide, or accidental or justifiable homicide (i.e self-defence) are not included." [@TorontoOpenData]. Since this information was provided by Toronto Police Services, it is subject to extreme bias. As seen with recent protests demanding more accountability from Police institutions worldwide, there is a great lack of transparency when it comes to police brutality and racism within the force. Therefore, it is important to ask whether homicide at the hands of the police are considered in this dataset, or if they would rule cases as 'self-defence' and exclude it.

Another factor that could influence the dataset is whether or not the courts have decided on a ruling for homicide cases. There are cases that could be ongoing or verdictless. Therefore, the number of deaths from homicide could not be accurately represented per year if cases are still awaiting trial.

 2.2. Methodology

The materials used for data collection and processing is R [@R], knitr [@R-knitr], Open Data Toronto [@R-opendatatoronto], Tidyverse [@R-tidyverse], ggplot2 [@R-ggplot2], dplyr [@R-dplyr], janitor [@R-janitor], and bibtext [@R-bibtext]. I began by downloading the data from Open Data Toronto, then cleaning and extracting it. I wanted to look at data from the most recent years so I filtered the data to only show cases from 2013 to 2020. I wanted to analyse Toronto homicides and each type first, then look at which neighbourhoods had the highest rates. First, I created a table that focused on the types of homicides in Toronto and the total count throughout the years [@table]. I then plotted this onto a stacked bar graph to visualize the changes and see which type was most dominant [@graph].
